required size  and combining back all that you have split with "Compression" 
options . It is suitable solution if you're dealing with
floppies (and superfloppies) and large packages often. PowerSplitter
provides a lot of cool and unique features that makes this program
extremely useful. This means that

Key features
------------
One can find bundle software available in the market. Which Can split/combine files
to/from floppy disks and to/from hard disk. But this software has a unique feature such as:
THERE ARE TWO CHOICES... THAT IS  "Split" or "Compress" Files

1) One can compress (with the help of "Zlib.dll" library) larger files to small ones  
before splitting. With level compression from (1 to 9) .1 being the almost no compression
and which is very fast on the other hand the 9 being the slowest compression and yield a 
good compression.But here i have used limited level.

2) Multiple files handling. Multiple files can be split to one set of volume( with Compression) 
To Separate files to binary chunks and Self-joining volumes.

3) There is an extra file .000. Which contain information about the spited files.
   .000 file contain header and files (name,type,size,compressed Size,CRC etc.) info.......

4) Binary splitting. It can produce binary chunks of original file for Later recombining 
on non-Windows machine (DOS, Unix or Mac). The Power Splitter generates the batch file to
restore original in DOS. This file is able to restore files from any removable media as well
As from hard disk.

5) Variable split sizes. (Splits in Segments options.)

6) Source and destination redirection. Very useful for splitting/combining files to/from 
different kinds of media or to/from different folders. 

7) Default directories for split and combine.

8) File removal after successful (Orignal) split operation and (Split) join operation. 
9) Auto-launching of combined files.

10) Check the File CRC  (cyclic redundancy check). Here is have used 32 bit CRC check which     isvery fast. One can also use CRC 8,16.
11) Run program from with in.... (new)

The possible usage scenarios are:
  1) During work or study hours (or in other time) you can download the
   programs, games, information (in general - files) using high speed
   Internet connection. Then, split all these files to disks and combine
   them at home.
   
  2)For storage or backup purposes you can save large files (i.e. databases,
   distributive packages) on other media.
   
  3)If you want to e-mail big file to someone, but your or your addressee's
   Internet Service Provider (ISP) rejects messages larger that some limit
   size (really, doesn't matter what is the limit). Split this file using
   PowerSplitter to any size pieces and mail these parts to recipient. In
  addition, he (or she) may not have the PowerSplitter installed. The
  program has self-joining (.bat) feature file to restore the original file.
  

  4)If you hold a FTP or other online communication service, you can
   use PowerSplitter to divide large files to smaller parts to allow users 
   with unstable Internet connection to retransmit not all huge package,
   but a small chunk of it.


How To Install/Uninstall PowerSplitter
-------------------------------------
Installing PowerSplitter is very easy. It is only necessary to unzip
and run the setup.exe file and follow installation instructions. For
uninstallation, use Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.'
